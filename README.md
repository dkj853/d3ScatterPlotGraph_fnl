## Stories:

## Stories:
# 1: I can see a title element that has a corresponding id="title".

# 2: I can see an x-axis that has a corresponding id="x-axis". 

# 3: I can see a y-axis that has a corresponding id="y-axis". 

# 4: I can see dots, that each have a class of dot, which represent the data being plotted. 

# 5: Each dot should have the properties data-xvalue and data-yvalue containing their corresponding x and y values. 
# 6: The data-xvalue and data-yvalue of each dot should be within the range of the actual data and in the correct data format. For data-xvalue, integers (full years) or Date objects are acceptable for test evaluation. For data-yvalue (minutes), use Date objects.

# 7: The data-xvalue and its corresponding dot should align with the corresponding point/value on the x-axis. 

# 8: The data-yvalue and its corresponding dot should align with the corresponding point/value on the y-axis. 

# 9: I can see multiple tick labels on the y-axis with %M:%S time format.

# 10: I can see multiple tick labels on the x-axis that show the year. 

# 11: I can see that the range of the x-axis labels are within the range of the actual x-axis data. User Story #12: I can see that the range of the y-axis labels are within the range of the actual y-axis data. 

# 13: I can see a legend containing descriptive text that has id="legend". 

# 14: I can mouse over an area and see a tooltip with a corresponding id="tooltip" which displays more information about the area. 

# 15: My tooltip should have a data-year property that corresponds to the data-xvalue of the active area. Here is the dataset you will need to complete this project: cyclist-data.json.
